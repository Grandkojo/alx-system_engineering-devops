HBNB Hotel Management System Postmortem: The Great Database Adventure 🚀
Issue Summary:

Duration of the Outage:
Start Time: January 15, 2023, 08:00 AM GMT
End Time: January 15, 2023, 11:30 AM GMT

Impact:

🚧 The booking service hit the snooze button, taking a morning break.
🐢 Users experienced the website in "chill mode" due to slow response times.
🎉 Approximately 30% of users were temporarily on an unexpected vacation from bookings.
Root Cause:
The villain of the story? A mischievous misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings, causing the database server to throw a "Too Many Connections" party.

Timeline:

08:00 AM GMT: 🚨 Monitoring alerts went bonkers, screaming about a sudden increase in database connection errors. Someone forgot to invite the database to the morning coffee chat.

08:15 AM GMT: Investigation kicked off, thinking, "Did we just go viral, or is the database feeling extra popular today?" Spoiler: It was the latter.

08:30 AM GMT: Oops! Turns out, the database server wasn't expecting so many friend requests and started rejecting connections. Quick pivot in strategy needed.

09:00 AM GMT: Called in the Database Operations superheroes, capes and all, to save the day.

09:30 AM GMT: Superheroes identified the culprit - a misconfigured connection pool setting hogging all the fun.

10:00 AM GMT: Rescued the database by tweaking the connection pool settings. Crisis averted, and the database started responding to connection requests like a newfound extrovert.

11:30 AM GMT: Service back in action! Users rejoiced, and the database promised not to play hard to get.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The villain, misconfigured connection pool settings, gate-crashed the party and created a database connection bottleneck. The poor database wasn't ready for so many connections - it's an introvert at heart.

Resolution:
Applied a bit of social therapy to the database, fine-tuning the connection pool settings to accommodate more friends. Also, set up a monitoring babysitter to ensure it doesn't go on a connection spree again.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Things to be Improved/Fixed:

Automated Scaling: Teach the database to be more flexible with automated scaling. It's time for it to learn the art of adapting to the crowd.

Load Testing: Schedule regular load testing sessions. The database needs a rehearsal before the big event to avoid stage fright.

Documentation Review: The database's instruction manual needs a revamp. Clearly, someone misread the "Connections for Dummies" chapter.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement Automated Scaling: Enroll the database in an adaptive yoga class for automated scaling. Flexibility is the key!

Regular Load Testing: Organize load testing sessions regularly. Let the database face its fears and come out stronger.

Documentation Update: Rewire the database's brain by updating the documentation. Make sure it understands it's okay to embrace connections without breaking a sweat.

In conclusion, the HBNB hotel management system's database went on an unexpected adventure. The misconfigured settings were the mischievous troublemakers, but fear not! With a dash of humor, some tweaks, and a commitment to socialize responsibly, the database is back in action, ready to handle the next crowd. Stay tuned for more tech tales! 🚀🌟
